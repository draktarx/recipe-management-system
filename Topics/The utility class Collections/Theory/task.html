Utility classes are associated with a class rather than an instance of a class and can be invoked directly using the class name, without requiring an object to be created. Class methods, which are the methods in a utility class, can only access static variables and call other static methods of the same class. They are typically used for utility functions that don't depend on the state of an object.

They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static methods</a> for creating and processing collections. Some of the methods represent generic algorithms, which means they can work with different types of collections.</p>
<p>It is often the case that programmers forget about this class and reinvent its methods from scratch. Obviously, it's better to remember about this class and check whether it contains the operations you need to perform with a collection.</p>
<p>Let's consider some groups of the provided methods. The full list of the method is available in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collections.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the official documentation</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Please, do not confuse the <code class="language-java">Collections</code> class and the<strong> </strong><code class="language-java">Collection</code> interface. They both belong to the <code class="language-java">java.util</code> package but represent completely different things.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="creating-immutable-collections">Creating immutable collections</h5>
<p>The first group is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3573" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a set is a collection of unique elements, similar to a mathematical set. | It is fundamentally different from arrays or lists because it is not possible to access an element by its index. Sets are used when you need to keep only unique elements within a collection, get rid of duplicates in a sequence, or perform mathematical operations. The Java Collection Framework provides the Set interface to represent a set as an abstract data type. Some commonly used set implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet, which are mutable and have different rules for ordering elements and are optimized for different types of operations. Immutable sets, whose names are not important for programmers, also implement the Set interface.">set</a> of methods for creating empty and single-element <strong>immutable</strong> collections.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;String&gt; emptyList = Collections.emptyList();
Set&lt;Integer&gt; emptySet = Collections.emptySet();

List&lt;Integer&gt; singletonList = Collections.singletonList(100);
Set&lt;String&gt; singletonSet = Collections.singleton("Hello");</code></pre>
<p>Using these methods look pretty straightforward. But why do we need empty and single element collections? For example, empty collections are often used as the return values from methods instead of <code class="language-java">null</code> to avoid NPE.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static Collection&lt;Integer&gt; algorithm(Collection&lt;Integer&gt; numbers) {
    // lots of lines of code
    if (some_condition) {
        return Collections.emptyList(); // instead of null
    }
    // lots of lines of code
}</code></pre>
<p>Singleton collections are extremely optimized to work with a single value. As an example, the class <code class="language-java">SingletonList&lt;E&gt;</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SingletonList&lt;E&gt; extends .. implements ... {

    private final E element;  // storing a single element

    SingletonList(E obj) {
        element = obj;
    }

    // some fields and methods
}</code></pre>
<p>Apart from this, the class also provides methods to create immutable collections from other collections:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
numbers.add(10);
numbers.add(12);
List&lt;Integer&gt; immutableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(numbers);</code></pre>
<p>There are similar methods: <code class="language-java">unmodifiableSet(set)</code> and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Remember that it's impossible to change elements within immutable collections. Methods that change elements (<code class="language-java">add</code>, <code class="language-java">clear</code> and so on) will throw <code class="language-java">UnsupportedOperationException</code> when being invoked.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Integer&gt; singletonList = Collections.singletonList(10);
singletonList.add(20); // throws UnsupportedOperationException</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Starting with Java 9, there is an alternative way to create immutable collections: <code class="language-java">List.of()</code>, <code class="language-java">List.of(1, 2)</code>, <code class="language-java">Set.of("Hello")</code>. But it is still useful to know about the previous way of doing that since it is often present in existing code.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We skipped the methods for creating maps, but they look very similar. If you need them, just look into the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
<h5 id="processing-lists">Processing lists</h5>
<p>There are also some methods for performing list-specific operations: <strong>sorting</strong>, <strong>reversing</strong>, <strong>rotating,</strong> and <strong>shuffling</strong> lists.</p>
<p>Check them out on the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4)); // getting a mutable list

Collections.sort(numbers);    // [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
Collections.reverse(numbers); // [4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]
Collections.shuffle(numbers); // randomly permutes the list

System.out.println(numbers);  // a result can be any: [4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1]</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">rotate</code> method shifts the elements in the specified list by the given distance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4));

Collections.rotate(numbers, 1); // [4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3]
Collections.rotate(numbers, 2); // [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
<p>These methods can be very useful in many applications. The listed methods have overloaded versions as well.</p>
<h5 id="calculations-on-collections">Calculations on collections</h5>
<p>There are some methods that can be applied to any collections since the methods take a <code class="language-java">Collection</code> interface as an argument.</p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-java">frequency</code> counts the number of elements equal to a specified object;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">min</code> and <code class="language-java">max</code> finds the minimum and maximum elements according to the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3573" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a natural order is the order defined by the `compareTo` method of the `Comparable` interface. | It is used to sort objects of a class that have a natural or inherent order, such as numbers or dates. When a class has an obvious natural ordering, implementing the `Comparable` interface is a suitable choice. The `Comparable` interface defines the natural ordering for objects of a class implementing it, making it ideal for comparing objects that inherently have a certain natural order, such as numbers or dates.">natural order</a> of elements;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">disjoint</code> checks that the two collections do not contain common elements.</p></li></ul>
<p>Here is an example of applying the listed methods.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4);

System.out.println(Collections.frequency(numbers, 3)); // 2
System.out.println(Collections.min(numbers)); // 1
System.out.println(Collections.max(numbers)); // 4

System.out.println(Collections.disjoint(numbers, List.of(1, 2))); // false
System.out.println(Collections.disjoint(numbers, List.of(5, 6))); // true</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>If the collection is empty, the methods finding <strong>min</strong> and <strong>max</strong> will throw <code class="language-java">NoSuchElementException</code>. But the <code class="language-java">frequency</code> will just return 0.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">Collections</code> class contains some other methods for working with collections as well.</p>
<h5 id="a-tricky-example">A tricky example</h5>
<p>We would like to demonstrate one tricky and interesting example with some modifying operations on <strong>immutable</strong> collections. Just take a look at the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Integer&gt; singletonList = Collections.singletonList(1);

Collections.sort(singletonList);    // it doesn't throw an exception
Collections.shuffle(singletonList); // it doesn't throw an exception

List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Collections.unmodifiableList(List.of(2, 1, 3));
Collections.shuffle(numbers); // it throws UnsupportedOperationException</code></pre>
<p>The first and second operations work without throwing an exception since a list containing only a single element doesn't require any modifications to be sorted or shuffled unlike the list with three elements. But if you replace <code class="language-java">Collections.singletonList(1)</code> with <code class="language-java">List.of(1)</code>, the first and second operations will also fail. Even immutable collections have behavioral peculiarities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>In order not to confuse other programmers it's better not to rely on such somewhat counterintuitive features of Java in your solutions, even if they are fun enough. After a while, you will also forget why such code works.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>We've considered the <code class="language-java">Collections</code> class that provides a set of useful methods for collections. Before you start writing your code when working on a problem related to processing collections it is a good idea to check the suitable methods in this class. It will allow you not to reinvent a wheel and use standard methods achieving good performance.</p>
